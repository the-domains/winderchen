  According to data from Strategy Analytics, Apple shipped just 800,000
  smartphones in India in the second quarter of 2016. That's fairly typical of
  its recent performance in the world's third largest smartphone market, but
  still down compared to the same quarter last year, when it shipped 1.2 million
  handsets.
